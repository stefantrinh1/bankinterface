##Summary  

A OOP Project in Python - A Bank which creates accounts and can deposit, withdraw and transfer money between accounts.

This is a Python Project built using Object Orientated Programming. It is a command line program that replicates banking options such as creating an account and basic account functions. This has no GUI and is solely a text based program.

The project was created to practice making a program with object orientated programming. I created the bank and accounts as objects with all the objects having their own attributes and methods such as withdrawing and depositing. The information was stored in data structures such as lists and key value pair dictionarys. when visiting the project online click run to test it.
